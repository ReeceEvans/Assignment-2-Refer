        <div class="col five"><p>Travis Scott has owned many different vehicles over time but here is one of his newest vehicles.The Lamborghini Aventador SV, the vehicle has a price of £315,000. The Superveloce has been designed as the sportiest Lamborghini ever, thanks to a further improved naturally aspirated V12 engine, engineering solutions geared to extreme lightness, and a mix of innovative technological features, such as the magnetorheological push-rod suspension and the Lamborghini Dynamic Steering system.</p>
<p>Every element of the SV has been developed following the “Design to Weight” concept, with the lowest possible weight and highest possible performance, to make it the fastest and most exciting Lamborghini of all time. </p><img src="images\Lambo.jpg" alt="Lamborghini Aventador SV">
