Astroworld was a Six Flags Houston amusement park that was shut down in 2005. In a 2017 interview with GQ Style, Travis stated: They tore down ‘AstroWorld’ to build more apartment space. That’s what it’s going to sound like, like taking an amusement park away from kids. We want it back. We want the building back. That’s why I’m doing it. It took the fun out of the city.</p>
